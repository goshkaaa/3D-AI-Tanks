# 3D-AI-Tanks

**3D AI Tanks** is a Unity-based tank shooter game featuring simple yet engaging game mechanics, user interface integration in both world and screen space, structured game architecture, and basic audio mixing.  
Unlike the original project, this version replaces the second player with an AI-controlled opponent, introducing a PvE experience and streamlining gameplay.

## About the Project

This project is based on Unity's **Tanks! Tutorial**, originally presented at **Unite Boston 2015** and available on the [Unity Learn platform](https://learn.unity.com/project/tanks-tutorial).  
It was expanded to demonstrate how AI can be integrated into a local multiplayer setup to create a solo-friendly PvE experience.
